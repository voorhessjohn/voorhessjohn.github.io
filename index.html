His technical acumen allowed him to produce insights that have tripled the scale of our outreach and halved our liabilities. If I had more than this limited command of language, I would pay more compliments."</p>

	<h3>Sarah Businesswoman</h3>
	<p>"John? Ohhhh, Elevator Guy! We called him 'Elevator Guy' because we all seemed to see him in the elevator. Turns out he never worked here. He just showed up in the morning and rode the elevator all day. I sat at his table in the cafeteria one day and he insisted that we race to see who could eat the fastest. He barely chewed his sandwich and said 'See you in the elevator!' through a mouthful of food before running off. I heard they kicked him out of the building a couple weeks ago. Is he ok?"</p>
